### A Homebrew Chat Program Based on TCP with Win32, Extended from UIC-COMP3003 Assignment 2

A simple console chat program using TCP protocol, implemented with Win32 API.
Joseph wants to port this app to Linux and macOS but he don't have any time.

Clients defaultly join lobby group when they first connect to server.
Server is capable of grouping clients from lobby, via console commands.

In future, we might implement a TUI by rendering console buffer. 
Portability will limit the function completeness.
